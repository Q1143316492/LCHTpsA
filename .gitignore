# Note on Content folder: by default we track Content/ in source control. If you prefer to exclude
# large binary assets, configure Git LFS and add patterns to .gitattributes instead of ignoring
# the whole Content/ directory here.

# Git LFS hint (not applied automatically):
# Add a .gitattributes file with patterns like:
# Content/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

/Content/*

# Local config
*.local
*.localbuild

# Misc
.idea/
.vscode/*

# Keep this file committed to the repo root
